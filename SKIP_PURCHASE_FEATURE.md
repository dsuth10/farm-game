# Skip Purchase Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the skip purchase feature that allows players to skip sheep and housing purchases in rounds 2 and beyond, using their existing flock for calculations.

## Problem Statement

Previously, players were required to purchase sheep and housing in every round before they could proceed to calculations. This prevented players from:
- Using their existing flock for calculations
- Focusing only on feed costs and wool income
- Saving money for future rounds
- Having flexibility in their purchasing strategy

## Solution

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Game State Management
- Added `canSkipPurchases` property to track when skip functionality is available
- Set to `true` for rounds 2 and beyond
- Reset to `false` when game is reset

#### 2. UI Enhancements
- **Skip Purchase Button**: Added dynamically in rounds 2+ with clear labeling
- **Information Box**: Shows current flock size and housing capacity
- **Visual Feedback**: Disabled state for purchase inputs after skipping
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains existing layout and styling

#### 3. Purchase Flow Logic
- **Validation**: Ensures player has sheep and sufficient housing before skipping
- **State Management**: Sets purchase counts to 0 when skipping
- **Input Disabling**: Prevents confusion by disabling purchase inputs after skip
- **Immediate Calculation Enablement**: Allows calculations to proceed immediately

#### 4. Calculation Updates
- **Dynamic Cost Calculation**: Only includes purchase/housing costs when purchases are made
- **Updated Guides**: Modified calculation guides to reflect optional costs
- **Worked Examples**: Updated to show conditional cost inclusion
- **Profit Calculation**: Handles cases with and without new purchases

#### 5. CSS Styling
- **Skip Button**: Orange accent color with hover effects
- **Info Box**: Blue gradient background with clear typography
- **Disabled States**: Visual indicators for disabled inputs and buttons
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods Added

1. **`updatePurchaseSectionVisibility()`**
   - Dynamically adds/removes skip purchase button
   - Shows informational message about current flock
   - Handles cleanup when feature is not available

2. **`handleSkipPurchase()`**
   - Validates prerequisites (sheep exist, housing sufficient)
   - Sets round data to indicate no new purchases
   - Enables calculations immediately
   - Disables purchase inputs

3. **`disablePurchaseInputs()`**
   - Disables all purchase-related inputs and buttons
   - Adds visual disabled state styling
   - Prevents user confusion

### Modified Methods

1. **`initializeGame()`**
   - Sets `canSkipPurchases` flag based on round number
   - Calls `updatePurchaseSectionVisibility()`

2. **`advanceRound()`**
   - Updates purchase section visibility for new round
   - Maintains skip functionality across rounds

3. **`calculateCorrectAnswer()`**
   - Uses current round data for purchase costs
   - Handles zero purchase scenarios

4. **`showWorkedExample()`**
   - Shows conditional cost inclusion in examples
   - Adapts to skip purchase scenarios

5. **`updateGuideValues()`**
   - Uses current round data for accurate calculations
   - Reflects actual purchase state

## User Experience Flow

### Round 1 (No Skip Option)
1. Player must purchase sheep and housing
2. Calculations proceed normally
3. All costs included in profit calculation

### Rounds 2+ (Skip Option Available)
1. **Option A - Purchase New Items**:
   - Player can purchase additional sheep/housing
   - All costs included in calculations
   - Normal validation applies

2. **Option B - Skip Purchases**:
   - Player clicks "Skip Purchase - Use Existing Flock"
   - System validates existing flock and housing
   - Purchase inputs are disabled
   - Calculations proceed with existing flock only
   - No new purchase/housing costs in profit calculation

## Validation Rules

### Skip Purchase Validation
- **Must have sheep**: Player cannot skip if flock size is 0
- **Housing sufficient**: Current flock must fit in existing housing
- **Round requirement**: Only available in rounds 2+

### Housing Validation (Maintained)
- If player wants to purchase new sheep later, housing requirement still applies
- Housing capacity must be sufficient for total flock size
- Round advancement blocked if housing insufficient

## Benefits

1. **Educational Flexibility**: Students can focus on different aspects of the game
2. **Strategic Depth**: More complex decision-making about when to expand
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler rounds when focusing on existing operations
4. **Better Learning**: Clear separation between expansion and maintenance costs
5. **Improved UX**: More intuitive flow for subsequent rounds

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: First Round
- Skip button should not appear
- Normal purchase flow required
- All costs included in calculations

### Test Case 2: Second Round with Existing Flock
- Skip button should appear
- Information box shows current flock size
- Skip should enable calculations immediately
- Purchase inputs should be disabled after skip

### Test Case 3: Second Round with No Flock
- Skip button should appear but be invalid
- Error message when trying to skip
- Must purchase sheep first

### Test Case 4: Second Round with Insufficient Housing
- Skip button should appear
- Error message when trying to skip
- Must purchase housing first

### Test Case 5: Calculations After Skip
- Feed cost = existing flock × feed cost
- Wool income = existing flock × wool price
- Profit = wool income - feed cost (no purchase/housing costs)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Indicators**: Show which costs are included in current round
2. **History Tracking**: Track which rounds used skip feature
3. **Analytics**: Include skip usage in teacher reports
4. **Advanced Options**: Allow partial skips (skip sheep but buy housing)

## Files Modified

1. **`js/game.js`**: Core game logic and new methods
2. **`css/main.css`**: Styling for skip functionality
3. **`index.html`**: Updated help modal and calculation guides

## Conclusion

The skip purchase feature successfully addresses the original problem by providing players with flexibility in rounds 2 and beyond. The implementation maintains educational value while improving user experience and strategic depth. The feature is well-integrated with existing game mechanics and provides clear visual feedback to users.
